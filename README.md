An example markdown document showing change detection using the BEAST algorithm on a time series of satellite-derived spectral indices. 

The webpage with code can be found [here](https://chrismulverhill.github.io/beast-example/)

To run the example on your own, you can download the NBR rasters [here](https://ln5.sync.com/dl/b3ca5cdd0#xnv9ny3e-j62sn87y-yydr392f-eepszyua). The file format lists the date in the format YYYYDDD, where YYYY is the year, and DDD is the Julian day of the year.
